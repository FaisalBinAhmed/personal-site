				I'm a 26 years old software engineer based in Munich. I was born
				and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

				🎓 I'm a full-time student at{' '}
				<a href="https://tum.de" target="_blank">
					Technical University of Munich
				</a>
				. There, I've been pursuing my Master's in Informatics since
				summer 2018. My major subject areas are Software Engineering and
				Distributed Systems. I finished my Bachelor's in Computer
				Science & Engineering at{' '}
				<a href="www.aiub.edu" target="_blank">
					American International University - Bangladesh
				</a>
				. Since my childhood, I'd dreamt to study Computer Science - and
				I was fortunate enough to achieve this dream.

				👨‍💻 I am currently working for{' '}
				<a href="https://brainlab.com" target="_blank">
					Brainlab
				</a>{' '}
				- a medical technology company based in Munich. I work full-time
				in the GUI Engineering team.

				👨‍💻 I previously worked for a video streaming company called{' '}
				<a href="https://joyn.de" target="_blank">

				Storybook, and JavaScript/TypeScript.

				📝 When I'm not working or studying, I prefer to read books or
				write articles. I started writing in 2013 as a freelance tech
				writer. Soon I along with an Indian friend started a Windows
				application review website called 'MetroAppSauce' - focusing
				mainly on modern Windows Phone and WinRT applications. Much Like
				Windows Phone, our beloved project had to face its demise.
				<br />
				In 2017, I continued my writing career with a technology
				publication called Neowin. You can find all my written articles{' '}

				And if you want to read my current articles, head over to my{' '}

					Medium
				</a>{' '}
				blog. However, I don't write much nowadays.
			</Typography>
			<Typography>
				📚 I love reading - especially science related non-fiction
				books. Some of my favorites are: The Code Book by Simon Singh,
				The Gene by Siddhartha Mukherjee, Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari,
				and 1984 by George Orwell. More information can be found on my
